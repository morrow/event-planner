# Event Planner #
[Udacity Senior Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/senior-web-developer-nanodegree--nd802) Project #1: Meet-Up Event Planner
The goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in web forms by reconstructing an event planner similar to meetup.com. I chose to build a simple front-end application that uses localStorage to persist event and user data.
Libraries and Tools used include: Bower, SASS, Gulp, Jasmine, gulp-sass, gulp-eslint, and gulp-notify.
